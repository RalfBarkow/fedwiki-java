Embodiment Hypothesis
Constructionism
==========================================
Constructionist learning is when learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. It advocates student-centered, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge. Students learn through participation in project-based learning where they make connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge facilitated by the teacher through coaching rather than using lectures or step-by-step guidance.

Wiki extends its twenty year old namesake by providing an unbounded complement of markups of which only a few offer specific syntax for formatting text. The remaining markups configure plugins to show or do work we usually associate with applications.
