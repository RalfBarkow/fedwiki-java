Constructionism[32m wiki.dbbs.co[0m
==========================================
Constructionist learning is when learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. It advocates student-centered, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge. Students learn through participation in project-based learning where they make connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge facilitated by the teacher through coaching rather than using lectures or step-by-step guidance.

We wrote a mock data generator that was designed to push data into an aggregator, unlike El Dorado that used a pull model. This project never finished but we might reuse the data for other experiments. [https://github.com/WardCunningham/context-map-data/blob/master/regenerate.rb github]

Would you be interested in presenting at the Agile India conference virtually in Nov 2021? I understand you might not be very keen to speak at an Agile event. Few of the original thought leaders have the same reaction. But sometimes if I ask them enough, they do change their minds.
[36m << 49 find Creativity >>[0m
Ward is a computer programmer who believes in radically simplifying methods. He's best known as the inventor of the first wiki, and one of the pioneers of software design patterns and Extreme Programming, not to mention being a co-author of the Agile Manifesto. It's a real privilege to have Ward sharing from his wealth of experience at Agile India in his keynote: [[Creativity Before and After Agile]].

==========================================
Organisms small and large learn by building a model of the world around them then testing that model against what they see and adjusting accordingly. We'll call this a learning loop. We identify three era in computing based on the nature of this loop and the kind of feedback learning that they support.

[[S4]]: No single unit, regardless of level or scope, can have sufficient range of adaptive behavior to manage the risk of saturation alone, therefore, alignment and coordination are needed across multiple interdependent units in a network.
